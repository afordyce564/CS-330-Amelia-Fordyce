### helloWorld.cpp
  #### How I wrote this program
      1. Followed the instructions from the lab
      2. Wrote print statements to demonstrate how variables can be pointers to other variables
      3. Create an array of integers
      4. Write a for loop that iterates throughout the entire array and prints out success if value 2 is found in a cell
      
  #### Comments
      - I don't entirely understand how pointers work
      - I thought c++ for loops would be more complicated for some reason
      - Did not know how to not find 5 and say it's not there?
