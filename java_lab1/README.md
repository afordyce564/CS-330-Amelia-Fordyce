### nextYear.java
  #### How I wrote this program
        1. import the scanner module
        2. Create new Scanner object
        3. Declare nextYear variable (value is equal to the next year)
        3. Ask user for their birthyear
        4. Birthyear is subtracted from nextYear to get the user's age in the nextYear
        5. The user's age in the nextYear is displayed

          - adding int and float with lots of numbers after the decimal point (optional)
          - adding float and float
        2. Write tests for subtracting
          - subtracting int and int

          - subtracting int and float with lots of numbers after the decimal point (optional)
          - subtracting float and float
        3. Write tests for multiplying
          - multiplying int and int
          - multiplying int and float 
          - multiplying int and float with lots of numbers after the decimal point (optional)

        4. Write tests for dividing
          - dividing int and int
          - dividing int and float 
          - dividing int and float with lots of numbers after the decimal point (optional)
          - dividing float and float
        5. The user's results can be displayed if they write print statements for each test

### buyingArray.java
 #### How I wrote this program
        1. create double array to hold each item's price 
        2. assign array indexes for each item's price (ex. a[0] = 4.95)
        3. create variable for the total and add up all indexes (a[0] +a[1]+a[2]+a[3])
        3. create variable called tax and multiply the total by 7% tax
        4. create variable for the sum of the tax variable and the total variable
        5. Display the full total price

### chars_and_strings.java
  #### How I wrote this program
        1. create String with a value
        2. Create char array with characters from the String value, or any other word
        3. I tested a few different string methods and checked if char arrays could do the same
            - conversion from string to char array and char array to string
            - substrings
            - length 
        4. Display each method tested for char arrays and strings

### arrayListIntegers.java
  #### How I wrote this program
       1. create an ArrayList object for Integers
       2. Add an integer using add() - I added three 
       3. Remove an integer using remove()
       4. Set an integer's value using set()
       5. Return the ArrayList's size using size()
       6. Return if ArrayList isEmpty() - will result in true or false
       7. Display ArrayList.size() and ArrayList.isEmpty()
