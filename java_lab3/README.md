### gpa_calculator.java
  ### How I wrote this program
       1. Initialize variable to enter one letter grade
       2. Write selection statements for printing out a number for each letter grade according to the table
       2. Calculate lower and upper limits of date ages using your own age
       3. Compare lower and upper limits to your date's age
       4. For use case where we want to check if we are going out with a man named David, check both name and gender
       5. Print out answers for each use case
        
### guessing_game.java
   ### How I wrote this program
    1. Initialize variables for dog's weight, and dog's age in calendar years
    2. Write use cases for each comparison in the table
    3. If writing for conditions where dog's calendar age is 1 or 2, nest if/else conditions underneath an if condition for checking if calendar age is 1 or 2
    4. For the condition for other calendar ages, use formula (21 (1st 2 dog years) + (calendar years â€“ 2(1st 2 calendar years)) *5)
    5. Print out what the dog's age would be in dog years
        
### guessing_game_two_sentinels.java
 ### How I wrote this program
  1. Initialize variable for getting the user's input for the number they guess with
  2. I copy pasted my code from guessing_game.java, then added a keepgoing sentinel that asks the player if they want to keep going
  3 Wrote if/else statements to test whether the user guessed the number correctly or not
  4. 
  4. Add a default case for numbers that aren't the ones checked in the rest of the cases
  5. Print out the messages according to the use cases presented
  
  ### fizzbuzz.java
 ### How I wrote this program
  1. Initialize variable for getting the user's input for the number they pick
  2. Write if/else statements for each condition for fizzbuzz, then run to see if it works
  3. Wrapped if/else statements in while loop
  4. Initizalized a variable to be the first number in the range 1-100
  5. While loop condition is i < 101
  6. Add statement to add 1 to i every time while loop runs
 
 
 
 
## Make sure you test all kinds of different inputs to ensure that errors won't occur!
