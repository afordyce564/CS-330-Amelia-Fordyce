## History

1. What is the name of your language?
  	The name of my language is Golang, or Go, for short. 
    
2. When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or
need?
    Go was created in 2007 by Google. It was developed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was written to address its own problems in relation to multicore processors, networked systems and large codebases. Go was also designed to simplify the development of multithreaded applications and encourage concurrent programming. The language is based on C++, Java, and Python

3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games,
mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of
different projects it's been used for.

Go can be used for server-side apps with support for multiple threads, cross-platform CLI tools, and other systems programming. 


4. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it?
At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any
other resources that relate to your language in particular.

I will get information about Go from its documentation, the W3 schools tutorial, and the tutorialspoint tutorial

## Get Started

1. What did you need to do to install the language?

  The installation of Go was pretty easy. First I downloaded the compiler from the Go website. (https://go.dev/dl/). I chose the latest build.

2. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not,
how did you pick the one that you'll be using?
  
  The most recommended programming environment for Go is Visual Studio Code. There is an extension for Go developed by Google. 

3. How do you run programs in that language?
  
   To run programs in Go, you need to write a main function that looks like this:
   
   func main(){
	  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
  }
   
   fmt is a popular module for Go that is for output
   You can run Go programs in Visual Studio Code. 
  
4. How do you write comments in your language?

  Writing comments in Go is similar to Java because you denote comments with //
