### dog_age_calculator.java
   #### How I wrote this program
    1. Initialize variables for dog's weight, and dog's age in calendar years
    2. Write use cases for each comparison in the table
    3. If writing for conditions where dog's calendar age is 1 or 2, nest if/else conditions underneath an if condition for checking if calendar age is 1 or 2
    4. For the condition for other calendar ages, use formula (listed here eventually) 
    5. print out what the dog's age would be in dog years
