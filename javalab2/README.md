### creepy_dating_conditional.java
  #### How I wrote this program
       1. Initialize variables for your age, your date's age, name, and gender
       2. Calculate lower and upper limits of date ages using your own age
       3. Compare lower and upper limits to your date's age
       4. For use case where we want to check if we are going out with a man named David, check both name and gender
       5. Print out answers for each use case
        
### dog_age_calculator.java
   #### How I wrote this program
    1. Initialize variables for dog's weight, and dog's age in calendar years
    2. Write use cases for each comparison in the table
    3. If writing for conditions where dog's calendar age is 1 or 2, nest if/else conditions underneath an if condition for checking if calendar age is 1 or 2
    4. For the condition for other calendar ages, use formula (21 (1st 2 dog years) + (calendar years â€“ 2(1st 2 calendar years)) *5)
    5. Print out what the dog's age would be in dog years
        
### enter_a_number_switch_statement.java
 #### How I wrote this program
  1. Initialize variable for getting the user's input for the number they pick
  2. Wrote a switch statement, initially with one case for each number and testing the print statements
  3. After looking online how to write statements for multiple statements ex (case1 : case 2:), rewrote eight cases into four cases
  4. Add a default case for numbers that aren't the ones checked in the rest of the cases
  5. Print out the messages according to the use cases presented
 
 
## Make sure you test all kinds of different inputs to ensure that errors won't occur!
